# Muneeb Ahmed . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from York University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have 18 months of professional experience as a Software Engineer. At AiFocal, I led the development of a project called Defai, which enabled users to create AI chatbots without coding, as well as integrating with messaging platforms like WhatsApp. My experience includes working with frontend technologies such as Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also contributed to backend components to ensure functionality, security, and accessibility for high-traffic web applications. I am enthusiastic to bring my experience and expertise to new challenges in the software industry. My goal is to develop products that make technology accessible and efficient for everyone.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent to monitor hardware specs and usage across Linux clusters. Used Bash for automation, PostgreSQL for data management, Docker for container management, and Git for version control. The project simplifies system monitoring with automated scripts and a PostgreSQL database, enabling system admins and developers to optimize performance. Features include real-time data collection, automated database updates, and essential insights into system health. Future plans include updating hardware spec changes and integrating data visualization tools.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - Grep App: Developed a Java-based application mimicking the grep command functionality from UNIX, enabling efficient search across large datasets. Leveraged Java 8 Streams and lambda expressions for pattern matching and file processing, enhancing performance and readability. The app recursively scans directories and outputs matched lines to a file, utilizing regular expressions for search criteria. Implemented robust error handling and optimized memory usage by processing files line by line, making it suitable for large-scale data processing.

## Highlighted Projects
**Rookery**: Developed a serverless bird identification learning website using Nextjs and AWS Amplify. Users can learn about Toronto birds in a fun and interactive way by doing engaging quizzes. This was created to make learning free for Toronto bird watchers. These quizzes are stored and managed using GraphQL, DynamoDB and AWS S3. Enhanced user experience by tracking and saving individual progress using AWS authentication.

**FitAI** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ryzzer0/FitAI)]: Built FitAI, a Next.js web application that uses AI to help users craft personalized workout plans. Users fill out their current health and fitness goals through a modern and user friendly form designed using Mantine, and OpenAI API is used for generating the customized workout content. FitAI ensures secure user authentication and real time database updates using Firebase.
