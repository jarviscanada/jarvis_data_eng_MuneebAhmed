# Muneeb Ahmed . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from York University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. At AiFocal, I led the development of the Defai project, which enabled users to create AI chatbots without coding, as well as integrating with messaging platforms like WhatsApp. My experience includes working with frontend technologies such as Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also contributed to backend components to ensure functionality, security, and accessibility for high-traffic web applications. I am enthusiastic to bring my experience and expertise to new challenges in the software industry. My goal is to develop products that make technology accessible and efficient for everyone.
