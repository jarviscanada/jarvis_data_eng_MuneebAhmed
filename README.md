# Muneeb Ahmed . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from York University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have 18 months of professional experience as a Software Engineer. At AiFocal, I led the development of a project called Defai, which enabled users to create AI chatbots without coding, as well as integrating with messaging platforms like WhatsApp. My experience includes working with frontend technologies such as Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also contributed to backend components to ensure functionality, security, and accessibility for high-traffic web applications. I am enthusiastic to bring my experience and expertise to new challenges in the software industry. My goal is to develop products that make technology accessible and efficient for everyone.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent to monitor hardware specs and usage across Linux clusters. Used Bash for automation, PostgreSQL for data management, Docker for container management, and Git for version control. The project simplifies system monitoring with automated scripts and a PostgreSQL database, enabling system admins and developers to optimize performance. Features include real-time data collection, automated database updates, and essential insights into system health. Future plans include updating hardware spec changes and integrating data visualization tools.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Stock Quote App: Developed a stock wallet simulator that utilizes the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve stock data and a PostgreSQL database to persist user transactions. The application allows users to view stock quotes, buy stocks, and manage their portfolio with an infinite amount of virtual cash. Technologies used in this project include JDBC for database connectivity, PostgreSQL for data storage, Maven for project management and build automation, and Docker for containerization.
  - Grep App: Developed a Java-based application mimicking the grep command functionality from UNIX, enabling efficient search across large datasets. Leveraged Java 8 Streams and lambda expressions for pattern matching and file processing, enhancing performance and readability. The app recursively scans directories and outputs matched lines to a file, utilizing regular expressions for search criteria. Implemented robust error handling and optimized memory usage by processing files line by line, making it suitable for large-scale data processing.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed/tree/master/springboot)]: Developed an app that is designed to manage client accounts and execute security orders within a trading system. The application facilitates the management of clients and their accounts, executes buy and sell orders for securities, and provides real-time market data. The project uses Java, Spring Boot, Docker, PostgreSQL, and integrates with the Alpha Vantage API for market data.

**Angular App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MuneebAhmed/tree/master/angular-frontend)]: Developed a trading application using Angular, integrating with a Spring Boot backend. The application features real-time data updates, user authentication, and a responsive UI. Utilized Angular Material for UI components, RxJS for state management, and NgRx for handling complex state interactions. The backend services were built with Spring Boot, providing RESTful APIs for data access and manipulation. Docker was used for containerization, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.


## Highlighted Projects
**Rookery**: Developed a serverless bird identification learning website using Nextjs and AWS Amplify. Users can learn about Toronto birds in a fun and interactive way by doing engaging quizzes. This was created to make learning free for Toronto bird watchers. These quizzes are stored and managed using GraphQL, DynamoDB and AWS S3. Enhanced user experience by tracking and saving individual progress using AWS authentication.

**FitAI** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ryzzer0/FitAI)]: Built FitAI, a Next.js web application that uses AI to help users craft personalized workout plans. Users fill out their current health and fitness goals through a modern and user friendly form designed using Mantine, and OpenAI API is used for generating the customized workout content. FitAI ensures secure user authentication and real time database updates using Firebase.
